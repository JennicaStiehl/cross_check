Project: Cross Check
Group Member Names: Erin King, Earl Stephens, Jennica Stiehl
Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Erin - better understanding of new tools and ruby
Earl - work on object interaction, learning Rake and SimpleCov, git in group settings, different branches
Jennica - become more comfortable with file I/O and to be able to work better on understanding project pieces that I didnâ€™t do.

All members understand the entire project - we will know we are successful when each member is able to explain the project to a third party.
Functionality - Completion up to iteration 4 and into iteration 5 or 6.
Version Control: PR for each iteration and most features/classes; include specific comments. Use Slack for communication.
TDD - Include Mocks and stubs; write tests first ; test coverage near 100%. Test for Single Responsibility
OOP - Use the principle of single responsibility; clearly named methods, tests.
